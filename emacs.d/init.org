* init.el
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el
:END:

This file is where all of the Emacs config magic happens. It's a thin =emacs-lisp= file that evaluates the contents of my =emacs.org= file so I can edit the =emacs.org= file, refresh my =.emacs.d/init.el= with =C-x C-r= and minimize the amount of restarts or convoluted tangling of all of my config.

First, as with all of my tangled files, make sure it's clear that this file is auto-generated.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; AUTO-GENERATED FROM dotfiles/init.org
#+END_SRC

=package-initialize= sets up the load-paths and autoloads for installed packages. It's a good way to make sure you don't get undefined variables or functions at load time.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Evaluate =emacs/configuration.org=

Now we'll create a temporary buffer with the =emacs/configuration.org= contents...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file "~/dev/github.com/lingard/dotfiles-1/emacs.d/configuration.org")
#+END_SRC

start at the =point-min= or first accessible point in the buffer and go forward one line until we've reached the end of the buffer (=eobp=)...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (not (eobp))
      (forward-line 1)
#+END_SRC

If it finds =#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp=, which is the source code block for =emacs-lisp=, find to the end of the block (=#+END_SRC=) and eval that region that we've just found...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (cond
       ((looking-at "^#\\+BEGIN_SRC +emacs-lisp *$")
        (let ((l (match-end 0)))
          (search-forward "\n#+END_SRC")
          (eval-region l (match-beginning 0)))))
#+END_SRC

and finally, close out the =emacs-lisp= expression from the previous =src= blocks form above.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ))
#+END_SRC

And that's all there is to it!

* Tangle Configuration Files

Ideally, all of the files would be generated by a push of a button, but I'm not there yet and I'm still honing in the rest of my =emacs= config, which is more pressing.

** To Tangle Files

Open the buffer and run =C-c C-v t=. This will generate output into the filename that's in the =:tangle:= property for the heading.

** To Evaluate Files

This one is a little tricky. For files that need to be evaluated as shell scripts (such as =osx-defaults.org=), every source block needs to be visited and have =C-c C-c= followed by =yes=. Ideally, the way =init.el= is loaded could also be a function that takes a files to read and retrofitted to do for =shell= what =init.el= does for =emacs-lisp=.
